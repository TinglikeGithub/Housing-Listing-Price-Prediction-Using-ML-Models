**About Me**

My name is Ting Pan. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, complemented by a rich foundation in Economics, Finance, and Law. My keen interest lies in utilizing data science to address tangible real-world challenges.

**Project Objective**

The project aims to predict housing listing prices using data gathered from a housing sales website, which includes details about different house features. 

**Project Process**

The process begins with feature engineering to extract both numerical and categorical data. Next, text data is embedded using an LLM model from Hugging Face. Finally, the datasets are merged, and XGBoost and Random Forest models are trained to predict listing prices. 

**Outcome**

The XGBoost model demonstrates superior performance compared to the Random Forest model, resulting in a relatively high R^2
